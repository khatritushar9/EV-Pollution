# EV-Pollution
Exploratory Data Analysis of sales of EV and pollution across the globe countrywise to understand if the increase in sales of EV has reduced the pollution levels.
Source of data on pollution:  https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database
Source of data on EV sales: https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/global-ev-outlook-2022

Using the above dataset, I explored and visualised the data to find connection between yearly sales of EV and pollution level across different countries.
